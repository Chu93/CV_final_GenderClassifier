The Gender Classifier GUI was developed using QT. 
I used the kit: Desktop Qt 5.4.2 MinGW 4.9.1 32bit

Build the project with the following command:
<path to qmake.exe> <path to GenderClassifierGUI.pro> -spec win32-msvc2015 "CONFIG+=debug" "CONFIG+=qml_debug"

To run the project:
execute GenderClassifierGUI.exe from the debug directory in the build directory
